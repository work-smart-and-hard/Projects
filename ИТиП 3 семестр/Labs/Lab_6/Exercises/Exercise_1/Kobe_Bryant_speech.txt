Man, I can't believe how fast twenty years went by. This is crazy. 
This is absolutely crazy. 
And you know, to be standing here at center court with you guys, my teammates behind me, and appreciating all this journey that we've been on. 
You know we've been through our ups and we've been through our downs, and I think the most important part is we all stay together throughout. 
I grew up a die-hard, I mean a die-hard Laker fan, die-hard. 
I knew everything about every player that has played here. 
So to be drafted and then traded to this organisation and to spend 20 years here, you can't write something better than this.
I'm more proud about … It is not about the championships, it is about the down years. 
I mean we did it the right way, we got our championships, all I can do is thank you guys, thank you guys for all the support, thank you guys for the motivation, thank you guys for the inspiration.
It's funny … the thing that had me cracking up all-night long was that I go through 20 years of everybody screaming pass the ball and on the last night everybody's like don't pass it!
This has been, this has been absolutely beautiful, I can't believe it comes to an end. 
You guys have been absolutely, absolutely beautiful. 
Thank you from the bottom of my heart. 
I love you guys, I love you guys. 
My family, to my family, my wife Vanessa, our daughtesr Nathalia, Gianna, thank you guys for all your sacrifices. 
All the time I spend in the gym and training, Vanessa holding down the family like the way you have, Vanessa I can't thank you enough, there is no way I can thank you enough for that. 
From the bottom of my heart, thank you.
What can I say, Mamba out.
